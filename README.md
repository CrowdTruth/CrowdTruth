# Welcome to CrowdTruth

The [CrowdTruth Framework](http://crowdtruth.org) implements an approach to machine-human computing for collecting annotation data on text, images, sounds and videos. The approach is focussed specifically on collecting gold standard data for training and evaluation of cognitive computing systems. The original framework was inspired by the [IBM Watson project](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/watson/) for providing improved (multi-perspective) gold standard (medical) text annotation data for the training and evaluation of various IBM Watson components, such as Medical Relation Extraction, Medical Factor Extraction and Question-Answer passage alignment.

The CrowdTruth framework supports the composition of CrowdTruth gathering workﬂows, where a sequence of micro-annotation tasks can be configured and sent out to a number of crowdsourcing platforms (e.g. <a href="http://crowdflower.com" target="_blank">CrowdFlower</a> and <a href="https://www.mturk.com" target="_blank">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a>) and applications (e.g. Expert annotation game <a href="http://game.crowdtruth.org" target="_blank">Dr. Detective</a>). The CrowdTruth framework has a special focus on micro-tasks for knowledge extraction in medical text (e.g. medical documents, from various sources such as Wikipedia articles or patient case reports). The main steps involved in the CrowdTruth workﬂow are:

1. Exploring &amp; processing of input data
2. Collecting of annotation data
3. Applying disagreement analytics on the results

These steps are realised in an automatic end-to-end workﬂow, that can support a continuous collection of high quality gold standard data with feedback loop to all steps of the process.
